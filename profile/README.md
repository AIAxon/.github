## 🧠 About Us

We are **Axon AI**, a team of five **Computer Engineering students from Marmara University**, passionate about building **production-ready AI systems** that don’t just work in theory — they scale in the real world.

Our focus lies at the intersection of **AI Engineering** and **MLOps**, where research meets infrastructure. We design intelligent, maintainable, and automated pipelines that power modern machine learning applications from development to deployment.

## 🚀 What We Do

At Axon AI, we:

* Develop **end-to-end AI solutions** — from data processing to scalable model serving.
* Build **MLOps architectures** with Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and AWS.
* Create **Generative AI** and **LLM-based** systems optimized for efficiency and reliability.
* Design **AI agents, RAG systems**, and **model monitoring tools** that bridge research and production.

We aim to transform complex AI ideas into **robust, industry-grade products**, pushing the boundaries of scalability, automation, and model performance.

## About Us

We are **Axon Team**, a group of five **Computer Engineering students from Marmara University**, dedicated to developing impactful, real-world technological solutions across multiple domains of modern computing.

Our expertise spans **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning Engineering**, and **Cybersecurity** — each pursued both independently and through collaborative team projects. With a multidisciplinary mindset, we build systems that are intelligent, secure, and aligned with real production needs.

## What We Do

At Axon Team, we focus on two core domains:

### **AI & Machine Learning Engineering**
We explore and build across the entire AI development pipeline — from data understanding to model creation and system-level design.  
Our work involves experimenting with modern learning approaches, developing practical AI solutions, and researching how intelligent technologies can be integrated into scalable and efficient systems.

### **Cybersecurity**
We study and implement methods for designing secure, resilient, and trustworthy infrastructures.  
Our efforts include identifying vulnerabilities, strengthening system robustness, and applying security principles to both software ecosystems and AI-driven environments.

### **How We Work**
Our team structure combines **individual specialization** with **collaborative engineering**:

- Each member advances in their own **domain-focused track** in AI/ML Engineering or Cybersecurity.
- At the same time, we work on **joint multidisciplinary projects** where these fields intersect to create solutions that are both intelligent and secure.

This approach enables us to deepen our expertise while delivering meaningful, production-inspired systems.
